# DBL Data Challenge 

## About the project 

Welcome to the public repository for the DBL Data Challenge project! 
This README file serves as a guide to help you understand our project, its purpose, and how it can provide valuable insights into airline data. 
Our team, Group 16, was responsible for analyzing data from the social media platform "Twitter" for our client, "Lufthansa." We compared the Twitter data of Lufthansa with their competitor, "American Airlines." 
The goal of our analysis was to gain insights into customer sentiments, preferences, and overall performance of the two airlines on social media
This project was developed as part of the Data Science program at the Technical University of Eindhoven.
